# Surgical-Instrument-Counter
The app automates surgical instrument counts during the operation and flags mismatches. The model implements an end-to-end computer vision pipeline that preprocesses data, masks complex and overlapping shapes, and auto-labels instruments for zero-shot training of a visual transformer model using LoRA finetuning and YOLO cross-validation.
